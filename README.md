# MetamaterialCalculator

Python + PyQt6 implementation of acoustic wave transmision properties calculator for designed layered metamaterial with 4 types of material: Fluid, Elastic-solid, Poro-elastic, Stiff panel (elastic-solid).
Plan for implementation:
1. Only GUI
2. Algoriothms for calculation metamaterial properties
3. Database communication: Metamaterial DB - save calculated data, +material properties DB
Send, Modify, Request, etc. using PostdegreeSQL
4. AI assistant for new materials creation, DB communation, analysis, etc.
